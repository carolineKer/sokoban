\section{Introduction}

    Sokoban is an popular puzzel dating back to the eighties.  The original setting of the puzzel is a warehouse and the problem is to push boxes
    around to predefined storage locations.  But the underlying problem is of course much more abstract.  The rules are simple~\cite{wiki_soko}: 
    %cite http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban
    \begin{enumerate}[I]
        \item  Only one box can be pushed at a time.
        \item A box cannot be pulled.
        \item The player cannot walk through boxes or walls.
        \item The puzzle is solved when all boxes are located at storage locations.
    \end{enumerate}
    Though the rules are simple the problem is quite difficult and has been proven to be $NP$-hard.
    This is not only due to the brancing factor but also the enormous deepth of the search tree~\cite{wiki_soko}.
